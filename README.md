# Homework

Here is sample code that is not working and by far not ideal.

1. Adjust code so it is working and follows best practices.
2. Add styling by your choice. (You can add styling library)
3. Connect todos to some real api.
4. Add Todo detail page (add routing to app, use context api for state managment from fetch todos to render todos and detail)
5. Todo component has defined shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle, but it can be done better, adjust it
5. Optional: rewrite Todo component to FC (choose if you want, prepare explanation)
